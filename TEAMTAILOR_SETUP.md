# TeamTailor Integration Guide

## üìã Overview

Jobbcentralen now integrates with TeamTailor career sites through their public RSS feeds. This integration allows us to aggregate jobs from hundreds of Swedish tech companies without needing API keys!

## ‚úÖ What's Working

- **RSS Feed Parser**: Automatically fetches and parses TeamTailor job feeds
- **No Authentication Required**: Uses public RSS feeds (no API keys needed!)
- **Unified Search**: Combined endpoint that searches both Platsbanken and TeamTailor
- **Source Toggle**: Users can switch between "Alla k√§llor", "Platsbanken", or "TeamTailor"
- **30-minute Cache**: RSS feeds are cached to avoid excessive requests

## üè¢ Currently Integrated Companies

Currently, we have **1 company** verified and active:
- ‚úÖ Teamtailor (their own career site)

## üì¶ Adding More Companies

### Step 1: Find TeamTailor Companies

You can find Swedish companies using TeamTailor in several ways:

1. **Google Search**:
   ```
   site:career.teamtailor.com Sverige
   site:career.teamtailor.com Stockholm
   site:career.teamtailor.com tech
   ```

2. **Company Lists**:
   - Check [TheirStack](https://theirstack.com/en/technology/teamtailor/se) for 588+ Swedish companies
   - Look for companies with career sites at `company.career.teamtailor.com`

### Step 2: Verify RSS Feed

Before adding a company, verify their RSS feed exists and is accessible:

```bash
# Test the RSS feed
curl https://COMPANY.career.teamtailor.com/jobs.rss
```

Example:
```bash
curl https://mentimeter.career.teamtailor.com/jobs.rss
```

If you get XML back with job listings, it's working! ‚úÖ

### Step 3: Add to Company List

Edit `server/utils/teamtailorCompanies.ts`:

```typescript
export const TEAMTAILOR_COMPANIES: TeamTailorCompany[] = [
  {
    name: 'Teamtailor',
    careerSiteUrl: 'https://career.teamtailor.com',
    enabled: true
  },
  // Add your new company:
  {
    name: 'Company Name',
    careerSiteUrl: 'https://company.career.teamtailor.com',
    enabled: true
  },
]
```

### Step 4: Test

Restart the dev server and test:

```bash
# Test TeamTailor endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/api/jobs/teamtailor

# Test combined endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/api/jobs/combined?source=all
```

## üìä API Endpoints

```

## üé® UI Integration

The main page (`app/pages/index.vue`) now includes:

- **Source Toggle**: Click the filter badge to cycle between sources
  - "Alla k√§llor" ‚Üí Shows jobs from both Platsbanken and TeamTailor
  - "Platsbanken" ‚Üí Only Platsbanken jobs
  - "TeamTailor" ‚Üí Only TeamTailor jobs

- **Source Badge**: Each job card shows which source it came from

## üîß Technical Details

### RSS Feed Format

TeamTailor RSS feeds include:
- Job title
- Job description (HTML formatted)
- Application URL
- Publication date
- Location(s)
- Department
- Role/Category
- Remote status

### Caching Strategy

- RSS feeds are cached for **30 minutes**
- Cache is stored in-memory on the server
- Can be bypassed with `?cache=false` query parameter

### Error Handling

- Failed company fetches are logged but don't break the entire request
- Errors are returned in the response for debugging
- Individual company failures are isolated

## üöÄ Suggested Companies to Add

Here are some verified Swedish tech companies using TeamTailor:

- Epidemic Sound
- Mentimeter
- Truecaller
- Northvolt
- Funnel
- Kry
- Budbee
- BookBeat
- Fishbrain

**Note**: Always verify the RSS feed works before adding!

## üìù Future Improvements

1. **Automatic Discovery**: Build a crawler to automatically find and verify TeamTailor companies
2. **Company Database**: Store companies in database instead of hardcoded list
3. **Health Checks**: Periodically verify RSS feeds are still accessible
4. **Better Location Parsing**: Improve municipality/region extraction from TeamTailor locations
5. **Job Deduplication**: Detect if same job appears on both platforms

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "fetch failed" errors

This usually means:
1. The RSS feed URL is incorrect
2. The company's RSS feed is not publicly accessible
3. Network/firewall issues

**Solution**: Verify the URL manually with curl first.

### No jobs returned

1. Check if the company actually has open positions
2. Verify the RSS feed has content: visit `https://COMPANY.career.teamtailor.com/jobs.rss` in browser
3. Check server logs for parsing errors

### Cache not updating

Clear the cache by adding `?cache=false` to the request, or restart the server.

## üí° Tips

- Start with companies you know are hiring
- Test RSS feeds manually before adding to ensure they work
- Consider regional companies based on your target audience
- Monitor server logs for fetch errors
- Update the company list regularly
